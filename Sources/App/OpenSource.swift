Some use functions to compose layouts, some use a more functional approach, some use a proxy approach, some simply add syntactic sugar to the existing API‚Äôs. Sometimes though you might want to use different approaches to layout within the same app. Layout doesn‚Äôt want to pick one solution and make you choose. Instead, it gives you the choice and flexibility to use whatever approach you want without adding layers of abstractions, allowing you to even pick and mix the standard APIs for some cases.")
